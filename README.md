# The Adventures of Leo – Game Pitch

This project is a concept developed during a sprint in my video game production course. I collaborated with a team of programmers and artists to create this pitch. Although it wasn't selected for further development, it showcases a unique narrative, gameplay loop, and early enemy design that I'm proud of.

##  Overview

**The Adventures of Leo** is a space-adventure game where the player controls Leo, a lone pirate navigating the galaxy. After an alien lifeform crashes into his ship disguised as a meteor, Leo must decide whether to abandon it—or take advantage of its unique abilities to protect his ship from space threats.

##  Game Loop

- Choose a destination from a star map.
- Defend Leo’s ship during the journey from attacking enemies.
- Arrive at the planet and ask the companion if they like the new location.
- Receive quests from local NPCs if the planet is suitable.

Each destination presents different challenges:
- New enemy types based on region.
- Planetary rings increase the chance of meteor damage.
- Difficulty increases over time and distance traveled.

##  Narrative Summary

Leo, a solitary space pirate, leaves his home planet in search of adventure. His journey is interrupted when a meteor crashes into his ship—only to reveal an alien creature inside. It's far too cute for Leo's taste, and he tries to get rid of it. But soon, he discovers that the creature is incredibly useful in defending the ship from space hazards.

##  Enemies & Combat

I was responsible for designing and programming enemy behavior. The prototype includes three enemy types:

- **Walking Fish**: Rushes directly at the player.
- **Space Seagull**: Flies around the player and attacks by gliding.
- **Cosmic Blobfish**: Launches meteors toward the player, requiring fast reactions.

I also implemented a wave-based system for spawning and managing enemies during travel sequences.



##  Status

 **Concept Stage Only** – This project pitch was not selected for full development, but it represents a complete idea built in a game jam-style sprint.
